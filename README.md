viral respiratory pathogens in Kenya; multi-site sentinel surveillance study
Vira respiratory infections constitute a major global health challenge, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in developing regions (World Health Organization [WHO], 2022). These infections result in an estimated 3-5 million cases of severe illness annually on a global scale, highlighting the magnitude of this health burden. The landscape of respiratory pathogens is diverse and complex, encompassing various viruses including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Smith & Johnson, 2021). In tropical regions like Kenya, the transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses differ from temperate zones, exhibiting less pronounced seasonality and potential year-round circulation.
The landscape of viral respiratory pathogens is complex and dynamic, encompassing a wide range of viruses including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses, including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. The relative prevalence and impact of these pathogens vary significantly based on geographical location, seasonal patterns, and host factors. In tropical regions like Kenya, the transmission dynamics differ from temperate zones, with less pronounced seasonality and potential year-round circulation of viruses.
Respiratory tract infections remain a significant public health concern in Kenya, particularly affecting vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (Ministry of Health Kenya, 2023). Between 2018 and 2019, influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) accounted for 10% of outpatient consultations in Kenyan healthcare facilities (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics [KNBS], 2020). Recent epidemiological data indicates an incidence rate of 10.7 episodes per 100 person-years for ILI/SARI between 2022 and 2023, with children under 15 years experiencing disproportionately higher rates (Kenyan National Influenza Center [NIC], 2023).
The aetiology of respiratory infections is notably diverse, with viral pathogens often presenting mild symptoms that may be exacerbated by secondary bacterial infections (World Health Organization [WHO], 2022). This complexity in diagnosis frequently leads to empirical antibiotic treatment, particularly in primary care settings within low and middle-income countries where diagnostic capabilities may be limited (Otieno et al., 2022). However, this practice overlooks the critical role of commensal bacteria in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections. The airways' resident non-pathogenic bacteria play a crucial role in augmenting immunity against viral pathogens (Smith & Johnson, 2021). Furthermore, empirical antibiotic treatment of respiratory infections without laboratory confirmation may disrupt the balance necessary for effective virus clearance, while also increasing the risk of emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.
In Kenya, significant knowledge gaps persist in respiratory infection diagnosis and management. A recent survey revealed that approximately 30% of medical practitioners believed unnecessary antibiotic treatment to be harmless (Kamau et al., 2022). This misconception, coupled with limited laboratory capacity for differential diagnosis, often results in antibiotic prescriptions driven by patient demand or medication availability rather than clinical necessity (Ouma et al., 2023). A notable surge in ILI/SARI cases was reported between May and July 2023 in Nakuru and Nyeri sentinel sites, which did not correlate with increased influenza transmission (NIC, 2023). Previous surveillance efforts in Kenya have typically focused on a limited range of pathogens, predominantly influenza viruses, leaving nearly half of all cases without definitive etiological diagnosis (Kipkoech et al., 2021).
To address these gaps, this study utilizes data collected at the National Influenza Center (NIC) from nine sentinel sites distributed across Kenya over a five-year period (September 2019 to September 2024). The study aims to determine the etiology of respiratory infections in vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. By expanding the panel of viral agents examined beyond previous studies, the research seeks to provide better evidence on disease etiology to local medical practitioners. Additionally, the study focuses on analyzing seasonal trends in virus circulation and genetically characterizing key pathogens including influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2, which are often responsible for more severe disease outcomes in vulnerable populations.
By providing comprehensive data on respiratory pathogen prevalence, seasonality, and genetic diversity, this study aims to enhance evidence-based clinical decision-making and contribute to more effective respiratory disease management strategies in Kenya. The findings will be particularly valuable for addressing the current knowledge gaps in respiratory tract infection diagnosis and management, ultimately leading to more targeted and appropriate treatment approaches for patients presenting with respiratory symptoms.
